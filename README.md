# Customer-Behavior-Prediction

This project implements a classification machine learning model to predict whether a customer will make a purchase and identifies the key features contributing to that decision.
Project Overview
Understanding and predicting customer purchase behavior is crucial for businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and improve customer engagement. This project utilizes various machine learning techniques to build a predictive model and derive actionable insights from customer data.
Key Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generated pie and bar charts using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to visualize feature distributions, uncover hidden information, and derive actionable insights.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented and compared multiple classification models:

Decision Tree Classifier
XGBoost
CatBoost


Hyperparameter Tuning: Applied various techniques to optimize model performance:

Optuna for Decision Tree Classifier
RandomSearchCV for CatBoost


Feature Importance Analysis: Calculated and ranked the importance of each feature in the customer's purchase decision to aid in strategic, data-driven business decisions.
